## Overview

Boosting VI NN is designed to leverage boosting methods to enhance the predictive performance of variational inference neural networks. By iteratively refining weak learners and combining their outputs, the framework aims to:
- Improve model accuracy.
- Handle complex data distributions.
- Offer robust uncertainty quantification.

This repository includes:
- The core boosting algorithm implementation.
- Example neural network architectures.
- Scripts for training and evaluation.
- Experiment logs and results for reproducibility.

## Features

- **Boosting Framework:** Implementation of a boosting mechanism tailored for neural networks.
- **Variational Inference:** Efficient techniques for approximating complex posterior distributions.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable components for experimenting with different neural architectures.
- **Reproducibility:** Scripts and configuration files to reproduce the experiments.
